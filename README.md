# Counting The Frequency of Words From Certain Books
I tip my hat to Kyle P. Johnson (https://github.com/kylepjohnson) for making http://kyle-p-johnson.com/assets/most-common-latin-words.txt
It has inspired me to make my own, but with specific books. I will add more features if I come up with any, and in the future, this won't just be with Latin.
Enjoy.
